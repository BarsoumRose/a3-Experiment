## Hypothesis 
Our study will focus on which type of graph is easiest to interpret and if color impacts the userâ€™s ability to interpret the graph. We will be comparing Bar graphs, Stacked Bar Charts, and Pie Charts. For our two trials of each chart, we will be using gray and red to act as the color variable in our study. We decided to choose red because of its brightness and notability to be associated with being quick (like Lightning McQueen :) ). 

We hypothesize that the Bar graph will be interpreted the easiest followed by the pie chart then the stacked bar chart. We are also hypothesized that the charts using color will be interpreted with more success than those with no color. 

## R Graphs and Analysis
We decided to create a boxplot with jitter of each chart type, graphing the error values using the ggpubr package, a cousin if you will of ggplot2. The box plot is great in that it shows the mean, range, error, and confidence intervals all on the same graph. The jitter also allows us to see all the data points on each chart, showing us any outliers that might be skewing the data.
